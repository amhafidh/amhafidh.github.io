    <h1>About The Tribe</h1>
    <p>
      The Tribe is a conglomeration of men who share the vision of becoming better physically,
      spiritually and above all - financially. We are committed to rising together in this journey
      of life across various stages. We share our learnings from the various experiences we undergo,
      what we read and what is shared with us by our elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tribe is a space for men to reclaim their manhood. To embody what a man is, his purpose,
      and role in the society, to his family and to himself. We do this by finding structure and logic
      from our African cultures and adopting what we deem fit from the modern world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our overall ambition is to be the best version of ourselves and to create a society where we will
      be proud to raise sons and daughters.
    </p>
